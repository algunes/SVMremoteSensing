At this study we applied the Support Vector Machine Classification Method to disaster damage assessment. We used an input dataset which computed with the local self-similarity descriptor for the change detection with footprints and compared pre- and post- images and deformations of the areas in medium and high resolution satellite images. The performance criteria of this classification simulations are 75% true positive and 28% false positive damaged buildings on the average.
